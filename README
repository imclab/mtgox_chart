This is a simple script used to plot the latest trades at Mt. Gox.

To run it, you need a recent version of Python2 (2.6 or 2.7 should
work) with matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ , available
in most linux distros).

Since the Mt. Gox data is quite heavy (more than 1MB), I would suggest
using the local file for testing. Switching is just a matter of
commenting/uncommenting one line in the file.
